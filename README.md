# CS210SNHU

Project One for CS210 involved creating a program which allows clients to view a 12 and 24 hour clock side by side.  The client would be able to select a choice from a menu which will modify the clocks on their website.

I believe I was able to create the functions well and make them easy to read.  They are not complex and uses the basic principles of C++.

I believe I could enhance my code by making it easier to read as well put more comments in my coding projects which would be helpful for others looking at my code and how it works.

The hardest part of the code I found to write was the loop for modifying the time when it came to a 12 hour clock.  I had a tutor assist me on how to implement the right code into my program.

Skills that will be transferable are problem solving skills as well as building the code in small increments so we're not stuck fixing a big block of code.

By creating numerous functions, the main function was simple to read as well as all the functions being in one place.
